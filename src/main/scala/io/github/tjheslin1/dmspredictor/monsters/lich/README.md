## Lich

### Assumptions

_Ray of Frost_ has been replaced with _Fire Bolt_. 
Since movement has not been implemented, and likely never will be, 
the Lich does not benefit from the movement reduction imposed by _Ray of Frost_ 
and instead deals more damage with _Fire Bolt_, which has no movement mechanics.

### Limitations

Currently no Legendary Actions are implemented.
