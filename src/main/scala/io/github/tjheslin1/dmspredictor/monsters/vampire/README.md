## Vampire

### Assumptions

The strategy chosen for the Vampire is to attempt to grapple on its first turn. If this fails it will attack again,
otherwise the Vampire will use _Bite_ on the _Grappled_ creature.

It is assumed from the description of _Unarmed Strike_ in the Vampire's stat block that the Vampire
automatically applies the _Grappled_ condition to a target that it hits with _Unarmed Strike_.

Since a Vampire is a very intelligent creature (Int of 17) it is assumed the Vampire has a good guess of who
is immune to the Charm condition as well as knowing who was pass the saving throw to already overcome its charm affect.

### Limitations
