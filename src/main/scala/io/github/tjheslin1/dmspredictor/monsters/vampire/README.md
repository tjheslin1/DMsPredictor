## Vampire

### Assumptions

The strategy chosen for the Vampire is to attempt to grapple on its first turn. If this fails it will attack again,
otherwise the Vampire will use _Bite_ on the _Grappled_ creature.

It is assumed from the description of _Unarmed Strike_ in the Vampire's stat block that the Vampire
automatically applies the _Grapple_ condition to a target that it hits with _Unarmed Strike_.

### Limitations

Currently no Legendary Actions are implemented.

Children of the Night (1/Day) is not implemented.
