## Barbarian

### Assumptions

- The _Barbarian_ will attack every turn and currently coming back from unconsciousness is not implemented.
Therefore the rule of a _Barbarian_ losing _Rage_ if it does not Attack or be damaged will not be tracked.

- The _Barbarian_ will always use _Reckless Attack_.

### Limitations

- Currently the Barbarian's _rageTurnsLeft_ isn't decremented.

- _Path of the Berserker_ Barbarian's currently don't gain exhaustion when _Frenzy_ ends, based on the first _Assumption_.

- _Path of the Totem Warrior_ Barbarian's only have the _Bear_ totem available.
