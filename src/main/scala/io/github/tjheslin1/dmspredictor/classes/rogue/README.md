## Rogue

### Assumptions

- To maximise the time that the rogue is hidden, the Rogue will attack first and then use its bonus action to _hide_.
After the first round the Rogue will be able to use its _sneak attack_.
The core rules are unclear as to how often _hide_ combined with _sneak attack_ is available to use.
In this simulation each turn the Rogue uses _hide_ by using the _stealth_ skill versus the monsters' _perception_ skill.

- When the Rogue uses _hide_, it will automatically succeed to hide from unconscious creatures.
This is to handle the event that a Rogue hides and then an enemy is revived.
