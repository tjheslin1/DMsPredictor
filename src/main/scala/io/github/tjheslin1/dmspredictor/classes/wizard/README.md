## Wizard

### Assumptions

- If the wizard has the the _Mage Armour_ spell it is assumed to have been prepared before the combat encounter
and given it last 8 hours it does not use up an available spell slot.

- All enemies are assumed to be within the range of _Fireball_ and no allies are hit. At level 3,
when _Fireball_ is available, the Wizard will already have taken the _School of Evocation_
_Arcane Tradition_ (the only one available in the Systems Reference Document (SRD)) and will be able
to utilise the _Sculpt Spells_ feature.
