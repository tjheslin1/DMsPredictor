### Assumptions

The Paladin will use as many points of _Lay on Hands_ as possible when healing an ally.

The Paladin will not use _Divine Smite_ on an enemy if the regular weapon attack kills it. 
This is to model the common scenario where the player is made of aware of when an enemy is 
very low and therefore a usage of _Divine Smite_ might be wasted.
